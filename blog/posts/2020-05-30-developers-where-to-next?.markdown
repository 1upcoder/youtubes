# Modern development

Modern Software Development isn't limited to algorithms, time and space complexity or those things you learnt about in University. The role of a Software Developer has expanded into operational support, system administration, user requirements gathering, and project management. With one person doing all of those jobs during the life cycle of many software projects. This evolution has occured because software developers aren't just nerds with Computer Science degrees. My current employer's Human Resources team can write simple scripts in Python. The Finance team are more adept and can write reports in Python using Pandas and database queries. You might be thinking, these guys aren't a threat to me because they don't know [how to rotate a red black tree](http://whywouldyouclickthat.com/) or what a [Treap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treap) is, they don't understand the difference between an [interpreted language and a compiled one](https://www.lifewire.com/compiled-language-2184210). My reply; Yes! but they do know what their bosses want and they are stepping around you and writing things quickly. The classical Software Developer has almost become extinct, their demise has made room for the two role businesses _think_ they want. Introducing the "Agile" DevOps Engineer and FullStack Developer. Let me go over what I've seen of these two role types and what I think is expected of them.

# DevOps. _Eat the crap you just cooked_ ~ anonymous 
_aka: Developer and Operations Engineer_

 Looking at what Wikipedia has to say about DevOps 
> **DevOps** is a set of practices that combines [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development "Software development") (_Dev_) and [information-technology operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology_operations "Information technology operations") (_Ops_) which aims to shorten the [systems development life cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle "Systems development life cycle") and provide [continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery "Continuous delivery") with high [software quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality).

My experience tells me Wikipedia has DevOps wrong. DevOps from what I've seen means that you are writing, building, testing, packaging, deploying, installing and supporting the software you and your team have built. Often this extends out into doing the same things for monitoring, visualization and environment management tools and applications. DevOps truly means that the Software Developer is also a System Administrator and first, second and third level application support. If you develop bad software then you end up supporting it. 
> Software development is like unsafe sex. One mistake and you are supporting it forever ~ N.A.B.G circa 2005

_The above has never been more true._

From a business perspective, a DevOps employee can reduce cost and time of the delivery and maintenance of a system. A lot of the knowledge of the application is in the head of the engineer(s). The company can avoid paying the cost of knowledge transfer if the engineer is always tied to the application that they have produced. Also the quality of the software will improve as well because the developer will not want to be woken up at 2am because their application 'crashed again'. Bug will get resolved, and improvements made faster.

Lets think of the DevOps role as a "Technologist". They have a depth of knowledge in many areas including, but not limited to: programming, networking, distributed computation, continuous integration, testing, robotic, and system administration. DevOps perform the non repetitive non manual task of translating manual/non manual repetitive business tasks to machine executable instructions for one or many computers to execute.


# FullStack. _Can you also sell the product too?_
I'll be upfront here. I've seen FullStack developer roles offered up on LinkedIn/jora/seek but I've never taken the time to truly understand what it is that the companies are looking for. But after talking with some colleagues I think I better understand. A FullStack Developer role will include dealing with and understanding stakeholders, gather requirements, extract user stores and understand the user experience. It will require design, integration, deployment and test planning. It will include development, testing, deployment and support. So it means that a FullStack developer can write the client and server code required for your application as well as any DevOps developer and can also deal with business stakeholders and clients. You are literally, the one stop IT team. My feeling here is that some developers will naturally migrate into these positions. These will be the developers who have a broad range and knowledge of lots of technologies and experience with the full Software Development Life Cycle.

Lets think of FullStake Developer as the "Interface" between business and technology. FullStack developers are a jack of all trades but a master of few. They can communicate ideas to Technologist and back to the business or their clients. They can do a lot of the things that the DevOps Engineer can do too. But they have a broader view of the Software Development Life Cycle.

# What is next?
This is what Software Developers and Computer Programmers need to be now; DevOps and FullStack.

What will it look like in the future?

We can already see that teams outside of the normal remit of development are writing scripts, not applications just yet. Their procedural scripts are interacting with business systems to generate data, visualisation and reports. This will continue to happen in a uncontrolled manner, non developers will write scripts which look like they have been put together on the back of a train ticket. They will lose their scripts, they will make mistakes and they will need help from professional Software Developers (or stackoverflow). People will continue to expand their knowledge and automate procedural tasks, freeing up their time and making them and their teams more successful and more productive. I think the need for _pure_ developers will continue to shrink. Developers with the inability to work with others will get pushed aside for the charismatic FullStack developer or the slightly more generic employee, the DevOps Engineer. The DevOps Engineer will slowly become the "normal" employee, some will have formal training in computer science and have a solid understanding of Software Development principals and practices. Some will be educated in other academic fields but understand enough to put some scripts or long lived application together. The FullStack developer should, in my view, expand into team leadership and project management of any team. After all FullStack Developers have an expansive knowledge and wisdom in dealing with interacting systems that are under constant change by the evolving requirements of business and its clients. They should be battle hardened in change procedures, process automation, large scale interacting systems, and planning. FullStack developers should utilise their knowledge in these fields and translate them to be effective with people and teams. But this could be easier said than done.


# How to survive?
As software becomes easier to write, programming languages more expressive the need for the pure developer diminishes. The Software Developer needs to either find refuge in their soft skills so that they can work effectively as part of a team or even leading a team. Because as everyone gets better at coding, _pure_ developers will only have their personalities to rely on.... and sometime that even scares me.

If this scares you too, try doing to following:
- Join a face to face team that doesn't involve technology. 
- Volunteer your time to some community effort outside of computer science. 
- Try moving around in the team taking different roles and responsibility.
